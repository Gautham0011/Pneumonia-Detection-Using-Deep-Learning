# Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning


--> The outbreak of the novel Corona virus disease (COVID-19) in December
2019 has led to global crisis around the world. The disease was declared
pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th of March 2020.
--> (RT-PCR) is the standard method for detection of COVID-19 disease, but it
has many challenges such as false positives, low sensitivity, expensive, and
requires experts to conduct the test.
--> Chest X-ray (CXR) scan images can be considered as an alternative as they
are fast to obtain and easily accessible.
--> There are number of approaches to classify CXR images and detect the
COVID-19 infections, the majority of these approaches can only recognize
two classes (e.g., COVID-19 vs. normal)
--> The current work proposes the use of a deep learning approach based on
trained Keras models.
--> This model performs two-way classification ,three-way classification and
four-way classification

 In this Project we aim to dive into a Present Societal Pandemic issue which
we are facing around us past 2 years due to outbreak of Novel Corona Virus.
-> Getting tested for covid-19 virus is not an easy deal with costly RT-PCR
test, and delayed results, and with its no. of variants with different mutations
emerging everyday all the new methods found to detect the virus and its
variant have either become :
- Ineffective as all tests may not find each of the variants.
- Each of them a set a finical restrictions for the technology used.
- Each test has its own detection time .
-> Chest X-Ray already exists and overcomes most of the above drawbacks,
but still fail to give long term effects or severity.
-> So as a Solution We Aim to develop a model to give large no. of
classifications and comparisons of Covid Patients and whether it leads to
pneumonia disease , also these models could be trained to classify long term
effects after years of infection how things could change w.r.t chest
infections, and lead to other chronic disease.
